0.4.1
---
- **compiler**
  - fix `objcopy` replacement to include the .data section in the firmware image
  - use `llvm-ar-7` on Linux to fix the Docker image

0.4.0
---
- **compiler**
  - switch to the hardfloat ABI on ARM, which is more widely used
  - avoid a dependency on `objcopy` (`arm-none-eabi-objcopy` etc.)
  - fix a bug in `make([]T, n)` where `n` is 64-bits on a 32-bit platform
  - adapt to a change in the AVR backend in LLVM 8
  - directly support the .uf2 firmware format as used on Adafruit boards
  - fix a bug when calling `panic()` at init time outside of the main package
  - implement nil checks, which results in a ~5% increase in code size
  - inline slice bounds checking, which results in a ~1% decrease in code size
- **targets**
  - `samd21`: fix a bug in port B pins
  - `samd21`: implement SPI peripheral
  - `samd21`: implement ADC peripheral
  - `stm32`: fix a bug in timekeeping
  - `wasm`: fix a bug in `wasm_exec.js` that caused corruption in linear memory
     when running on Node.js.
